  	-l      (The lowercase letter “ell”.) List files in the long format, as described in the The Long Format subsection below.

  	-t      Sort by descending time modified (most recently modified first).  If two files have the same modification timestamp, sort their names in ascending lexicographical
             order.  The -r option reverses both of these sort orders.

             Note that these sort orders are contradictory: the time sequence is in descending order, the lexicographical sort is in ascending order.  This behavior is mandated by
             IEEE Std 1003.2 (“POSIX.2”).  This feature can cause problems listing files stored with sequential names on FAT file systems, such as from digital cameras, where it
             is possible to have more than one image with the same timestamp.  In such a case, the photos cannot be listed in the sequence in which they were taken.  To ensure the
             same sort order for time and for lexicographical sorting, set the environment variable LS_SAMESORT or use the -y option.  This causes ls to reverse the
             lexicographical sort order when sorting files with the same modification timestamp.

	-R      Recursively list subdirectories encountered.

	-r      Reverse the order of the sort.

	-a      Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (‘.’).
